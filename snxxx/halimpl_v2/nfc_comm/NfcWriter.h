 * Class         NfcWriter

 * Description   The NfcWriter class is a singleton class responsible for
 *               writing data to an NFC Controller (NFCC) through a physical
 *               interface (e.g., I2C) using the NFCC driver interface.
 *               It ensures that only one instance of the class exists and
 *               provides various methods to handle the writing process,
 *including direct writes, enqueued writes, and handling write callbacks.
